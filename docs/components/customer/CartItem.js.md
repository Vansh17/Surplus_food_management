# CartItem Component

The `CartItem` component is responsible for rendering and managing the cart items in a mobile application. It fetches cart data from an API and displays it in a scrollable list. Each item in the cart can be removed by the user.

## Key Functions

### `cartGet()`

This function is responsible for fetching the cart data from the API. It uses the Axios library to make a GET request to the API endpoint. The function retrieves the user's token from the AsyncStorage and includes it in the request header for authentication. The response data is then set to the `cart` and `cartImg` states.

### `getToken()`

This function retrieves the user's token from the AsyncStorage. This token is used for authenticating API requests.

### `deleteCart(id)`

This function deletes a specific item from the cart. It takes the `id` of the item as a parameter and makes a DELETE request to the API endpoint. The user's token is retrieved from the AsyncStorage and included in the request header for authentication. The response data is then set to the `del` state.

## State Variables

- `cart`: This state variable holds the cart data fetched from the API.
- `cartImg`: This state variable holds the image data of the cart items.
- `del`: This state variable holds the response data after an item is deleted from the cart.

## Component Structure

The `CartItem` component returns a `View` component that contains the cart header and a `ScrollView` component. The `ScrollView` component maps through the `cart` state variable and renders each item in a `View` component. Each item displays the product name, expiry, quantity, and price. There are also buttons to increment, decrement, or remove the item from the cart.

## Styles

The `styles` constant defines the styles for the various elements in the component. It uses the `StyleSheet.create` method from React Native to create the styles.

## Example Usage

```jsx
<CartItem navigation={navigation} />
```

In this example, the `CartItem` component is rendered with the `navigation` prop passed to it. The `navigation` prop is typically provided by the navigation library (like React Navigation) and is used to navigate between different screens.
