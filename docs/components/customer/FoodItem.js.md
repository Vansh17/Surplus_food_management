# FoodItem Component Documentation

The `FoodItem` component is a React Native component that provides functionality for searching and adding food items to a cart, as well as fetching and displaying food recommendations based on location. This component interacts with a remote API to fetch and post data.

## Key Functions

### getToken()

This function retrieves the user's token from the AsyncStorage. This token is used for authorization when making requests to the API.

### fetchFoodItem()

This function retrieves a list of food items from the API. The user's token is used for authorization.

### addToCart(id)

This function adds a food item to the user's cart. It sends a POST request to the API with the food item's id and a quantity of 1. The user's token is used for authorization.

### fetchData(name)

This function fetches food items from the API based on a search term. If search parameters are provided in the route, they are used in the API request. Otherwise, default values are used.

### recommend_location()

This function fetches food recommendations based on the user's location. The user's token is used for authorization.

## Props

This component receives the following props:

- `navigation`: The navigation object from React Navigation. It's used to navigate between different screens.
- `route`: The route object from React Navigation. It's used to access parameters passed from previous screens.

## State

The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage several pieces of state:

- `search`: The user's search term.
- `food`: An array of food items fetched from the API.
- `cart`: An array of items in the user's cart.
- `searchTerm`: The term used to filter the list of food items.
- `recommend`: An array of food recommendations based on the user's location.
- `location`: A boolean indicating whether the user has provided a location.

## Usage

The `FoodItem` component is used to display a list of food items that can be searched and filtered. The user can add items to their cart and view recommendations based on their location.

The component renders a search bar at the top of the screen. As the user types into the search bar, the list of food items is filtered in real time. Each food item is displayed with its name, price, and location, and a '+' button to add the item to the cart.

If the user has provided a location, the component also fetches and displays a list of food recommendations for that location.
