# Customer Header Component Documentation

The `Customer_header` component is a header component used in a React Native application. It contains a search bar and filter functionality for customers to search and filter results based on their location.

## Props

- `navigation`: This prop is required for navigation between different screens in the application.
- `route`: This prop is used to get the current route's parameters.

## State

- `item`: This state variable is used to store the current input in the search bar.

## Functions

- `onPressFilter`: This function is called when the Filter button is pressed. It navigates the user to the 'FilterScreen'.

## Components

- `SafeAreaView`: It is a wrapper component that applies padding to the nested content based on the physical limitation of the screen.
- `View`: It is a fundamental component for building user interface.
- `Image`: It is used to display different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk, such as the camera roll.
- `TextInput`: It is a basic component that allows the user to enter text.
- `TouchableOpacity`: It is a wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased.
- `Divider`: It is a thin, lightweight separator that groups content in lists and layouts.

## Usage

The `Customer_header` component can be used in any screen where there is a need for a search bar and filter functionality. The user can input a location in the search bar and press the 'Go' button to navigate to the 'Customer_search' screen with the entered location and a boolean value. The 'Filter' button navigates the user to the 'FilterScreen' when pressed.

Example:

```jsx
import Customer_header from './path_to_component/Customer_header';

// In your screen component
render() {
    return (
        <View>
            <Customer_header navigation={this.props.navigation} route={this.props.route} />
            // other components
        </View>
    );
}
```

In this example, the `Customer_header` component is imported from its file location and then used in a screen component. The `navigation` and `route` props are passed to the `Customer_header` component.
