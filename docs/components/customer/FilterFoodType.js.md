# FilterFoodType Component Documentation

## Overview

The `FilterFoodType` component is a React Native component that is used to display different categories of food items. It provides a horizontal scroll view with different food categories represented by images. The categories include drinks, food, deserts, and snacks. 

## Component

The main component in this file is the `FilterFoodType` component. It's a functional component that uses the React Hook `useState` to manage the state. However, in the current state of the code, the state is not being used.

The component returns a `View` that contains a `ScrollView` and several other `View` components. The `ScrollView` is set to be horizontal, allowing users to scroll through the food categories horizontally.

Each category is represented by a `View` that contains an `Image` and a `Text` component. The `Image` component displays an image representing the category, and the `Text` component displays the name of the category.

There is also a `TouchableOpacity` component that wraps the `Text` component with the text "Clear All". This suggests that there might be functionality to clear all selected filters, but currently, there is no functionality attached to this button.

## Styles

The styles for this component are defined using `StyleSheet.create`. The `box` style is used to style the `View` that wraps the `Image` component. It sets the background color, height, width, border radius, and left margin of the box.

The `img` style is used to style the `Image` components. It sets the height, width, self-alignment, and top margin of the images.

## Example Usage

This component can be used in a parent component as follows:

```jsx
import FilterFoodType from './FilterFoodType';

function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <FilterFoodType />
    </View>
  );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

Please note that this component doesn't currently accept any props or provide any interactivity. To make it interactive, you could add event handlers to the `TouchableOpacity` components, and pass in the categories as props.
