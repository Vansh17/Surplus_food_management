# RecommendedItems Component Documentation

The `RecommendedItems` component is a React Native component that fetches and displays recommended items from an API. It also provides the functionality to add these items to a user's cart.

## Key Functions

### `getToken()`
This function retrieves a token from the AsyncStorage. This token is used for authorization when making requests to the API.

### `recommend_item_get()`
This function makes a GET request to the `/api/recommendations` endpoint to fetch recommended items. It sets the response data to the `cart` state variable.

### `recommend_item_post(id)`
This function makes a POST request to the `/api/cart/` endpoint to add an item to the cart. The item's id is passed as a parameter to this function. It sets the response data to the `food` state variable.

## State Variables

### `cart`
This state variable stores the recommended items fetched from the API.

### `food`
This state variable stores the response data when an item is added to the cart.

## UI Components

The UI of this component consists of a ScrollView that displays the recommended items. Each item is displayed with its name and price, and a "+" button to add the item to the cart.

## Example Usage

This component does not require any props to be passed in. It can be used as follows:

```jsx
<RecommendedItems />
```

When rendered, the component will automatically fetch the recommended items from the API and display them. When the "+" button of an item is pressed, that item will be added to the user's cart.

## API Logic

The component uses the axios library to make HTTP requests to the API. The base URL for the API is `http://wixstocle.pythonanywhere.com/`. The endpoints used are `/api/recommendations` for getting recommended items and `/api/cart/` for adding an item to the cart.

The requests to these endpoints require a token for authorization. This token is retrieved from the AsyncStorage using the `getToken()` function.
