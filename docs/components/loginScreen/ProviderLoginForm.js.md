# ProviderLoginForm Component Documentation

This file defines a `ProviderLoginForm` component in React Native, which is used for logging in a provider user. It uses the `Formik` library for form handling and `Yup` for form validation. It also uses `axios` for making HTTP requests and `AsyncStorage` for storing data locally in the device.

## Component Overview

`ProviderLoginForm` is a functional component that returns a form for a provider to log in. The form contains two fields: email and password. After the form is submitted, it sends a POST request to a login API endpoint to authenticate the user. If the authentication is successful, it stores the token received in the response in `AsyncStorage` and navigates to the `ViewOrderScreen`.

## Key Functions

- `simpleAlertHandler`: This function is used to show an alert when wrong credentials are provided.
- `getToken`: This function retrieves the token from `AsyncStorage`.
- `storeToken`: This function stores the token in `AsyncStorage`.
- `loginUser`: This function sends a POST request to the login API endpoint with the email and password. If the request is successful, it stores the token received in the response in `AsyncStorage` and navigates to the `ViewOrderScreen`. If the request fails, it shows an alert.
- `onPressForgot`, `onPressCustomer`, `onPressProviderOrder`, `onPressAdmin`: These functions are used to navigate to different screens.

## Props

This component does not take any props.

## State

- `login`: This state variable is used to store the response from the login API.
- `email`: This state variable is used to store the value of the email field.
- `password`: This state variable is used to store the value of the password field.
- `food`: This state variable is not used in the component.

## Example Usage

This component can be used in a screen component as follows:

```jsx
import ProviderLoginForm from './ProviderLoginForm';

function LoginScreen({ navigation }) {
  return (
    <ProviderLoginForm navigation={navigation} />
  );
}

export default LoginScreen;
```

In this example, the `ProviderLoginForm` component is used in a `LoginScreen` component. The navigation prop is passed to the `ProviderLoginForm` component to enable navigation to different screens.
