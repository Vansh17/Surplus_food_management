# SignupForm Component Documentation

The `SignupForm` component is a React Native component that provides a user interface for users to sign up for an application. It uses Formik for form management and Yup for form validation. It also uses axios to make HTTP requests to a server.

## Props

- `navigation`: This prop is used for navigation between different screens in the application.

## State

- `signup`: This state variable is used to store the response from the server after a successful signup.
- `email`: This state variable is used to store the email entered by the user in the form.
- `name`: This state variable is used to store the name entered by the user in the form.
- `phone`: This state variable is used to store the phone number entered by the user in the form.
- `password`: This state variable is used to store the password entered by the user in the form.

## Functions

- `simpleAlertHandler`: This function is used to display an alert when the user tries to sign up with an email, phone number, or password that already exists.
- `onPressLogin`: This function is used to navigate to the LoginScreen.
- `SignupFormSchema`: This is a Yup object that defines the validation schema for the form.
- `signupUser`: This async function is used to make a POST request to the server to sign up a new user. It takes four parameters: `name`, `email`, `password`, and `phone`.

## Formik

Formik is used to manage the form state. It provides functions and props to handle form submission and validation.

- `initialValues`: This prop is used to set the initial values of the form fields.
- `onSubmit`: This prop is used to handle form submission. It calls the `onSignup` function with the form values.
- `validationSchema`: This prop is used to set the validation schema for the form.
- `validateOnMount`: This prop is used to validate the form when it is first mounted.

## Styles

The component uses the `StyleSheet.create` method to define styles for the different elements. It uses the `styles` object to apply these styles.

## Usage

To use this component, import it and then use it in the JSX of another component:

```jsx
import SignupForm from './SignupForm';

// ...

<SignupForm navigation={navigation} />
```

Replace `navigation` with the navigation prop from your navigation library (e.g., React Navigation).
