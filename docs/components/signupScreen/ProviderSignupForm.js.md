# ProviderSignupForm Component Documentation

The `ProviderSignupForm` is a React Native component used to handle the signup process for a provider. It uses Formik for form management and Yup for form validation. It also uses Axios to make HTTP requests to the server.

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## State

The component uses the React `useState` hook to manage state for the following:

- `signup`: An array to store the response from the signup API call.
- `email`: A string to store the email input.
- `name`: A string to store the name input.
- `phone`: A string to store the phone input.
- `password`: A string to store the password input.

## Functions

### onPressLogin

This function navigates the user to the `ProviderLoginScreen`.

### SignupFormSchema

This is a Yup object that defines the validation rules for the form. It requires an email and a password of at least 6 characters.

### signupUser

This is an asynchronous function that makes a POST request to the `/api/register/` endpoint with the user's name, email, password, phone number, and user type. The response from the server is stored in the `signup` state variable.

## Rendered Components

The component renders a Formik form with fields for the user's name, email, password, and phone number. The form also includes a "Sign Up" button that triggers the `signupUser` function and navigates the user to the `ProviderLoginScreen`.

## Styles

The component uses the `StyleSheet.create` method from React Native to define styles for the form and its elements.

## Example Usage

This component is typically used in a signup screen for a provider. Here's an example of how it might be used:

```jsx
import ProviderSignupForm from './ProviderSignupForm';

const ProviderSignupScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Sign up as a provider</Text>
      <ProviderSignupForm />
    </View>
  );
};

export default ProviderSignupScreen;
```

In this example, the `ProviderSignupForm` component is rendered inside the `ProviderSignupScreen` component.
