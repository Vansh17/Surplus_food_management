# ForgotPasswordScreen Component Documentation

The `ForgotPasswordScreen` component is a React Native screen that is used to handle the "Forgot Password" functionality of an application. It is responsible for rendering the "Forgot Password" form, a logo, and a title.

## Props

This component accepts the following props:

- `navigation`: This is an object from React Navigation. It allows the component to navigate between different screens.

## Components

This component uses the following child components:

- `ForgotPasswordForm`: This component is responsible for rendering the form that allows users to reset their password. The `navigation` prop is passed to this component.

## Routes

This component does not define any specific routes but uses the `navigation` prop to navigate to other screens based on user interactions.

## State

This component does not maintain any local state as it is a stateless component.

## Styles

The component uses the `StyleSheet.create` method to define styles that are used within the component. The styles defined are:

- `container`: Styles for the main container.
- `login_title`: Styles for the title text.
- `texts`: Styles for the container of the title text.
- `logoContainer`: Styles for the logo container.
- `logo`: Styles for the logo image.

## Example Usage

This component is typically used within a navigation stack. Here is an example of how it might be used:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import ForgotPasswordScreen from './ForgotPasswordScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Forgot Password" component={ForgotPasswordScreen} />
        {/* Other screens */}
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `ForgotPasswordScreen` is added to a stack navigator, and can be navigated to by using the name "Forgot Password".
