# AddItemScreen Documentation

The `AddItemScreen` is a React Native screen component that renders an `AddItem` component. This screen is typically used in the context of a navigation stack, allowing users to navigate to this screen to perform actions related to adding an item.

## Props

- `navigation`: This is a prop passed by the navigation stack. It is an object that contains various methods for navigating between different screens, such as `navigate` and `goBack`.

## Components

- `AddItem`: This is a custom component imported from `../components/Provider/AddItem`. It is the main content of the screen. The `navigation` prop is passed down to this component, allowing it to initiate navigation to other screens.

## Styles

- `container`: This style is applied to the main `View` component of the screen. It has the following properties:
  - `flex: 1`: This makes the `View` expand to fill all available space.
  - `backgroundColor: 'white'`: This sets the background color of the `View` to white.
  - `paddingTop: 60`: This adds a top padding of 60 pixels to the `View`.

## Usage

The `AddItemScreen` is typically used as part of a navigation stack. Here is an example of how it might be included in a stack navigator:

```js
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import AddItemScreen from './AddItemScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="AddItem" component={AddItemScreen} />
        // other screens...
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `AddItemScreen` is associated with the "AddItem" route. This means that you can navigate to this screen from any other screen in the stack using `navigation.navigate('AddItem')`.
