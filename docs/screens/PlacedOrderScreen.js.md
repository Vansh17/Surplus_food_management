# PlacedOrderScreen Documentation

The `PlacedOrderScreen` is a React Native screen component that displays a list of orders that have been placed by the user. This screen is part of the Provider module and it includes a header, a list of placed orders, and a footer.

## Components

- `navigation`: This prop is used for navigating between different screens.
- `title`: This prop is a string that sets the title of the header. In this case, the title is "View Placed Orders".

## Styles

The `PlacedOrderScreen` component uses the `StyleSheet` API of React Native to create styles that are applied to the components. The `styles` object includes one style:

- `container`: This style is applied to the main `View` component. It sets the `flex` property to 1, which means the component will occupy the whole screen. The `backgroundColor` property is set to 'white'.

## Usage

The `PlacedOrderScreen` component is exported as a default export, which means it can be imported and used in other files like this:

```js
import PlacedOrderScreen from './PlacedOrderScreen'

// ...other code...

<PlacedOrderScreen navigation={navigation} />
```

The `PlacedOrderScreen` component expects a `navigation` prop, which should be an instance of React Navigation's navigation object. This object is used for navigating between different screens.
