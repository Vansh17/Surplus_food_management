- `navigation`: This prop is used to navigate between different screens in the application. It is passed to the `LoginForm` component.

## Components

### LoginForm

The `LoginForm` component is a custom component that provides a form for user authentication. It accepts a `navigation` prop that is used to navigate to different screens in the application.

## Styles

The `LoginScreen` component uses the `StyleSheet.create` method to define styles for the various elements in the component. The styles are defined in the `styles` object.

## Usage

The `LoginScreen` component is typically used as a screen in a navigation stack. Here is an example of how it might be used:

```js
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import LoginScreen from './LoginScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Login" component={LoginScreen} />
        // Other screens...
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `LoginScreen` component is used as the "Login" screen in a stack navigator. When the app is launched, the `LoginScreen` will be the first screen displayed to the user.
