# Dummy React Native Screen Documentation

The `Dummy` React Native screen is a functional component that fetches data from a remote API, displays the data in a list, and provides a search functionality to filter the list.

## Key Components

### `SafeAreaView`

This is a wrapper component that ensures the content is displayed within the safe area boundaries of a device.

### `TextInput`

This component is used to get user input for the search functionality. It triggers the `searchFilterFunction` on text change.

### `FlatList`

This is a performant interface for rendering simple, flat lists. It's used here to display the data fetched from the API.

## State Variables

- `search`: This state variable holds the search text entered by the user.
- `filteredDataSource`: This state variable holds the list of data that matches the search text.
- `masterDataSource`: This state variable holds the original data fetched from the API.

## Functions

### `useEffect`

This hook is used to fetch data from the API when the component mounts. The fetched data is set to both `filteredDataSource` and `masterDataSource`.

### `searchFilterFunction`

This function filters `masterDataSource` based on the search text entered by the user. If the search text is not blank, it filters the `masterDataSource` and updates `filteredDataSource` with the new data. If the search text is blank, it updates `filteredDataSource` with the original data from `masterDataSource`.

### `ItemView`

This function returns the UI for each item in the `FlatList`. It displays the item's id and title.

### `ItemSeparatorView`

This function returns a separator for the `FlatList` items.

### `getItem`

This function is triggered when a `FlatList` item is pressed. It displays an alert with the item's id and title.

## Styles

The `styles` object contains the styles for the components in the screen. It uses `StyleSheet.create` to ensure that the styles are immutable and referenced by ID instead of their values.

## Usage

This component can be used as a screen in a React Navigation stack. Here's an example:

```js
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import Dummy from './path-to-dummy';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Dummy" component={Dummy} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `Dummy` will be the initial screen of the app.
