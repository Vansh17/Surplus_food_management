# AcknowledgementScreen Component Documentation

## Overview
The `AcknowledgementScreen` component is a React Native screen component used to display a confirmation message to the user after a successful payment. It shows a success image, a success message, a thank you note, and an option to explore more.

## Props
This component receives the following prop:

- `navigation`: This is an object from React Navigation that contains various navigation functions that can be used to navigate between different screens.

## Component Structure
The component structure is as follows:

- A root `View` that wraps all other components. It has a `flex` style of 1 and a `backgroundColor` of `#fafbfb`.
- An `Image` component that displays a success gif image. The image is fetched from a URL.
- Two `Text` components that display success and thank you messages.
- A `View` component that wraps the thank you note and the explore more option. It has a `backgroundColor` of `#D9D9D9`, a `height` and `width` of 300, and a `borderRadius` of 50.
- A `TouchableOpacity` component that wraps a `Text` component. This can be used to navigate the user to another screen to explore more.

## Usage
This component is typically used after a successful payment process. Here is an example of how to use this component:

```js
import AcknowledgementScreen from './AcknowledgementScreen';

// ... within your component's render method
render() {
  return (
    <AcknowledgementScreen navigation={this.props.navigation} />
  );
}
```

Note: Replace `this.props.navigation` with the actual navigation object from your React Navigation stack.

## Styling
The component uses inline styling to style its child components. The styles include `backgroundColor`, `flex`, `height`, `width`, `alignSelf`, `marginTop`, `color`, `fontWeight`, `fontSize`, `textAlign`, and `borderRadius`.

## Future Enhancements
Currently, the "Explore More" button doesn't do anything when clicked. In the future, you can add a navigation function to this button to navigate the user to another screen. You can do this by wrapping the `Text` component inside the `TouchableOpacity` component with a function that calls `navigation.navigate('ScreenName')`.
