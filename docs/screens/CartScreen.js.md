# CartScreen Component Documentation

The `CartScreen` component is a screen component in a React Native application. It is designed to display the user's shopping cart and related information. This screen includes the list of items in the cart, recommended items for the user, and the cart's footer which likely includes options for checkout and viewing the total price of items in the cart.

## Components

This screen uses several imported components to create its layout:

- `CartItem`: This component displays an item that is in the user's cart. It likely includes information such as the item's name, price, and quantity. It also receives the `navigation` prop, allowing it to navigate to other screens when necessary.

- `RecommendedItems`: This component displays items that are recommended to the user, likely based on the contents of their cart or their past shopping history.

- `CartFooter`: This component represents the footer of the cart. It likely displays the total price of the items in the cart and provides options for the user to checkout or continue shopping. It also receives the `navigation` prop.

## Props

The `CartScreen` component receives the following props:

- `navigation`: This is a standard prop in React Navigation which allows the component to navigate to other screens.

## Styles

The `CartScreen` component uses a StyleSheet for its layout:

- `container`: This style is applied to the main View of the component. It sets the component to take up the full available space (`flex: 1`), sets the background color to white, and adds a top padding of 60.

## Usage

The `CartScreen` component is typically used as a screen in a React Navigation stack or tab navigator. Here's an example of how it might be included in a stack navigator:

```js
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import CartScreen from './CartScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Cart" component={CartScreen} />
        {/* Other screens... */}
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `CartScreen` is accessible by navigating to the route named "Cart".
