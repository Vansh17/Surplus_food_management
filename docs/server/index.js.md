# Node.js Backend Documentation

This Node.js file is a backend service that creates a server using Express.js and integrates with Stripe to create payment intents. It defines a single API endpoint `/create-payment-intent` for creating payment intents.

## Dependencies

- `express`: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, used to build web applications and APIs.
- `stripe`: Stripe is a payment processing platform. This library provides the interface for Node.js to interact with the Stripe API.

## Constants

- `app`: An instance of Express application.
- `port`: The port on which the server is running.
- `PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: The publishable key from your Stripe account.
- `stripe`: An instance of Stripe object initialized with the secret key and API version.

## API Endpoints

### POST /create-payment-intent

This endpoint is used to create a payment intent with Stripe. A payment intent represents an attempt to charge a customer's card. Once the payment intent is created, it returns a `clientSecret` which is used on the client-side to confirm the payment.

#### Request

No request body is required.

#### Response

The response is a JSON object containing the `clientSecret` of the payment intent.

- `clientSecret`: A unique key for the payment intent generated by Stripe.

#### Error Handling

If there's an error while creating the payment intent, the error message is logged to the console and the error message is sent as a response in the `error` field.

## Server

The server is started on the specified port and logs a message to the console with the URL where it is listening.

## Example Usage

To use this API, make a POST request to the `/create-payment-intent` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.48.150:3000/create-payment-intent
```

The response will be a JSON object with the `clientSecret`.

```json
{
  "clientSecret": "pi_1J2V8ZIuaZKlOa5WZ4zjEuVj_secret_JKlOa5WZ4zjEuVj1J2V8Z"
}
```

You can then use this `clientSecret` on the client-side to confirm the payment.
