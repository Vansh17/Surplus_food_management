# CartScreen.js Documentation

## Overview

`CartScreen.js` is a React Native component that serves as the main screen for the shopping cart functionality in an e-commerce application. It displays the items in the cart, recommended items, and the cart footer, which includes the total price of the items and the checkout button.

## Key Components

- `CartItem`: This component displays an individual item in the cart, including the item's image, name, price, and quantity.
- `RecommendedItems`: This component shows a list of items recommended for the customer based on their cart contents or browsing history.
- `CartFooter`: This component displays the total price of the items in the cart and a checkout button. When the button is clicked, the user is navigated to the checkout screen.

## Props

- `navigation`: This prop is passed to the `CartItem` and `CartFooter` components and is used for navigation between screens in the application.

## Styles

- `container`: This style is applied to the main View component in `CartScreen`. It sets the background color to white, the top padding to 60, and makes the component flex to fill the screen.

## Sample Usage

Here is an example of how the `CartScreen` component can be used in a React Native application:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import CartScreen from './CartScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Cart" component={CartScreen} />
        {/* other screens */}
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `CartScreen` is added to the navigation stack of the application. When the user navigates to the "Cart" route, the `CartScreen` component will be rendered.
