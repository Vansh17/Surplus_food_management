## Key Components/Functions

- `View`: This is a fundamental component for building user interfaces in React Native. It is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.
- `Text`: This is a built-in component that displays text. It supports nesting, styling, and touch handling.
- `StyleSheet`: This is a React Native library that allows you to create and manage styles in a more efficient way.
- `Image`: This is a built-in component that displays different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk, such as the app bundle.
- `LoginForm`: This is a custom component that handles user login.

## Props or Inputs

- `navigation`: This prop is passed to the `LoginForm` component to enable navigation between different screens in the app.

## Sample Usage

The `LoginScreen` component can be used in a React Native application as follows:

```jsx
import LoginScreen from './path-to/LoginScreen';

// In your component's render method
render() {
  return (
    <LoginScreen navigation={this.props.navigation} />
  );
}
```

This will render the login screen, which includes a logo image, a login title, and a login form. The `navigation` prop is passed to the `LoginForm` component to enable navigation between different screens in the app.
